# JBinaryAnalysis
I would like to make a tool which can analyze binaries and determine if it contains malware-like behavior.

## Features TODO
- File info display: contains basic attributes of the file
- Hashing and checksum calculations
- String extraction
- PE header parsing
- Disassembly
- All in a decent looking console-based gui
